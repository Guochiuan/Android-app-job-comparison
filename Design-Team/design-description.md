# Requirements

1. When the app is started, the user is presented with the main menu, which allows the user to (1) enter or edit current job details,
(2) enter job offers, (3) adjust the comparison settings, or (4) compare job offers (disabled if no job offers were entered yet). 
    
    * The app startup and lifecycle is handled within the main() method in the App class, which responds to any user selections by using the GUI to 
    display the appropriate page. The methods used by main() to handle the above options are as follows:
    	* Enter or edit current job details: setCurrentJob()/editCurrentJob().
    	* Enter job offer: enterJobOffer()
    	* Adjust comparison settings - adjustComparisonSettings()
    	* Compare jobs: compareJobs() and displayRankedOffers(). 

    If the 'jobList' field has any elements which have the isCurrentJob field set to false, then the user will be given the option
    to compare job offers; otherwise, the option will be disabled.

2. When choosing to enter current job details, a user will:

    a. Be shown a user interface to enter (if it is the first time) or edit all the details of their current job, which consist of:
        
           i. Title
          ii. Company
         iii. Location (entered as city and state)
          iv. Cost of living in the location (expressed as an index)
           v. Yearly salary
          vi. Yearly bonus
         vii. Retirement benefits (as percentage matched) (given as an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive)
        viii. Relocation stipend
          ix. Training and development fund ($0 to $18000 inclusive annually)
          
    * The details of the job are stored in the Job class. Each of the fields above are stored in the Job class (and validated to be within range if required).
    The user interface of entering or editing a job is handled by the GUI. When a job is selected for editing, the App class uses the editCurrentJob() method to
    edit the instance of the current Job.
    
    b. Be able to either save the job details or cancel and exit without saving, returning in both cases to the main menu.
        
    * This part is handled by the GUI when exiting and returning to the main menu. If a valid job offer is saved, both the currentJob instance as well as the instance
    of the current job that is stored in the jobList will be updated.
    
3. When choosing to enter job offers, a user will:
    
    a. Be shown a user interface to enter all the details of the offer, which are the same ones listed above for the current job.
        
    * The main() method works with the GUI to bring up the appropriate user interface.

    b. Be able to either save the job offer details or cancel.
 
    * If the user chooses to save the job offer details, a Job object will be created and the enterJobOffer() method
    will be called which will add the job to the 'jobList' array field. If the user cancels, the GUI will clear the input fields.

    c. Be able to (1) enter another offer, (2) return to the main menu, or (3) compare the offer (if they saved it) with the current job details (if present).
     
    * If the user enters another offer, they will be given an option by the GUI to save the details or cancel, as in the previous requirement.
    If the user chooses to return to the main menu, the GUI will display the appropriate main menu screen.
    If the user chooses to compare the offer, the compareJobs() method will be called with the saved offer and the 'currentJob' as parameters;
    however, if the user had not saved an offer or if there is not an existing 'currentJob', then the user will not be allowed to select this option.
    
4. When adjusting the comparison settings, the user can assign integer weights to:
    
    a. Yearly salary

    b. Yearly bonus
    
    c. Retirement benefits
    
    d. Relocation stipend

    e. Training and development fund 

    If no weights are assigned, all factors are considered equal.

    * The comparison settings are stored using the adjustComparisonSettings() method, which edits or sets an instance of the JobComparison class.
    The class contains the different parameters entered by the user. Initially the JobComparison class is initialized to equal weights and is
    used if the user has not entered a comparison setting. In addition, validation of the weights is also done before storing.
    
5. When choosing to compare job offers, a user will:

    a. Be shown a list of job offers, displayed as Title and Company, ranked from best to worst (see below for details), and including the current job (if present), clearly indicated.
 
    * The main() method will call the displayRankedOffers() method which will work with the GUI to display the jobs in appropriate order.
    The jobs will be ordered by their scores, which are calculated by passing the jobs to the calculateScore() method in the JobComparison class,
    and the current job (as tracked by the currentJob field) will be clearly indicated visually.
    
    b. Select two jobs to compare and trigger the comparison.
 
    * The compareJobs() method will be called which will be passed the two jobs desired to be compared.
    
    c. Be shown a table comparing the two jobs, displaying, for each job:

          i. Title
          ii. Company
         iii. Location
          iv. Yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
           v. Yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
          vi. Retirement benefits 
         vii. Relocation stipend
        viii. Training and development fund
     
    * The compareJobs() method will work with the GUI to display in a table the details of the jobs passed to it.
    
    d. Be offered to perform another comparison or go back to the main menu.
     
    * The GUI will provide the user with options to perform another comparison or return to the main menu, and display the appropriate page as chosen by the user.
    
6. When ranking jobs, a jobâ€™s score is computed as the weighted sum of:

    AYS + AYB + (RBP * AYS / 100) + RS + TDF

    where:
    AYS = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
    AYB = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
    RBP = retirement benefits percentage
    RS = relocation stipend
    TDF = training and development fund

    For example, if the weights are 2 for the yearly salary, 2 for relocation stipend, and 1 for all other factors, the score would be computed as:


    2/7 * AYS + 1/7 * AYB + 1/7 * (RBP * AYS / 100) + 2/7 * RS + 1/7 * TDF
     
    * The calculateScore() method in JobComparison uses the job's values along with the various weights (if assigned) to calculate the score.

7. The user interface must be intuitive and responsive.
	
	* This will be handled entirely by the GUI implementation.

8. For simplicity, you may assume there is a single system running the app (no communication or saving between devices is necessary).
	
	* This part simplifies the design by not requiring user login, although user state has to be stored between sessions.
