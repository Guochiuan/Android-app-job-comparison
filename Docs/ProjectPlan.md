# Project Plan

**Author**: Team059

## 1. Introduction

The 'Job Comparison' application is designed to allow users to keep track of their current job and/or job offers and easily allow
users to compare details of those jobs.

## 2. Process Description

- Develop project plan
    - Create a project plan which provides details about the team and project. This should include a basic description of the project;
        a description of the team's members as well as the roles those members have; and a list of activities required to complete the
        project, with the following details for each activity:
        1. A description of what that activity entails.
        2. Any inputs required for that activity.
        3. Any outputs produced by the activity along with an explanation of how a completed activity can be verified.  
    - This activity requires the assignment description for the group project deliverable 2 and 3.
    - This activity will produce a project plan which will, at a high level, describe the various objectives that must be
        completed in order to finish the project.
- Create use-case model
    - Create a use case diagram which contains all of the actors and use cases for the application. For each use case, a description should be
        written which contains the following information:
        1. A high-level description of the use case.
        2. What is required in order for the use case to run.
        3. What must be true after the use case has been run.
        4. A list of steps that make up a performance of that use case.
    - This activity requires the design description document.
    - This activity will produce a diagram which displays the primary actions the user can take in the application, as well detailed descriptions
        of what those actions entail and how they can be performed.
- Create design document
    - Create a design document which details any considerations or assumptions taken into account regarding the project, the constraints and environment
        involved with the system in which the application is running, a high-level architectural design of the system, a diagram which describes the various
        components involved in the application as well as their interactions, a diagram or description of how the application will be deployed on actual devices,
        a low-level design description of each of the application's components, a class diagram of the application, and any other diagrams that may be needed to describe
        the application.
    - This activity requires the design description document.
    - This activity will produce a document which provides a detailed description of the application's design.
- Create application
    - Create an Android application which allows users to track their current job and/or any job offers they might have, and allow
        users to compare the details of the jobs they are keeping track of.
    - This activity requires the design description document as well as software such as Android Studio to develop the application.
    - This activity will produce an Android application which will allow the user to perform the tasks detailed in this activity's description.
- Create test plan
    - Create a test plan which describes the overall strategy that the team plans to take regarding the testing of the application, what techniques the team
        plans to use and how they plan to judge the quality of the tests, how the team plans to keep track of any bugs or enhancements they plan to implement,
        and what testing technologies the team plans to utilize. There should also be a table of test cases which includes a description of the purpose for each test,
        the required steps to perform each test, the expected and actual results for running the test, and information about whether that test has passed or failed.
    - This activity requires the design description document.
    - This activity produces a document which details the testing strategy being used for the application, as well as a concrete list of performable test cases.
